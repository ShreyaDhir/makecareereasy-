                            <p>Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.‚Äù
                                Types of machine learning
                                Classical machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its predictions. There are four basic approaches: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The type of algorithm a data scientist chooses to use depends on what type of data they want to predict.
                          
                              Supervised learning. In this type of machine learning, data scientists supply algorithms with labeled training data and define the variables they want the algorithm to assess for correlations. Both the input and the output of the algorithm is specified.
                                Unsupervised learning. This type of machine learning involves algorithms that train on unlabeled data. The algorithm scans through data sets looking for any meaningful connection. Both the data algorithms train on and the predictions or recommendations they output are predetermined.
                                Semi-supervised learning. This approach to machine learning involves a mix of the two preceding types. Data scientists may feed an algorithm mostly labeled training data, but the model is free to explore the data on its own and develop its own understanding of the data set.
                                Reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is typically used to teach a machine to complete a multi-step process for which there are clearly defined rules. Data scientists program an algorithm to complete a task and give it positive or negative cues as it works out how to complete a task. But for the most part, the algorithm decides on its own what steps to take along the way.

						<p >Uses of machine learning
                            Today, machine learning is used in a wide range of applications. Perhaps one of the most well-known examples of machine learning in action is the recommendation engine that powers Facebook's News Feed.
                            
                            Facebook uses machine learning to personalize how each member's feed is delivered. If a member frequently stops to read a particular group's posts, the recommendation engine will start to show more of that group's activity earlier in the feed.
                            
                            Behind the scenes, the engine is attempting to reinforce known patterns in the member's online behavior. Should the member change patterns and fail to read posts from that group in the coming weeks, the News Feed will adjust accordingly.
                            
                            In addition to recommendation engines, other uses for machine learning include the following:
                            
                            Customer relationship management -- CRM software can use machine learning models to analyze email and prompt sales team members to respond to the most important messages first. More advanced systems can even recommend potentially effective responses.
                            
                            Business intelligence -- BI and analytics vendors use machine learning in their software to identify potentially important data points, patterns of data points and anomalies.
                            
                            Human resource information systems -- HRIS systems can use machine learning models to filter through applications and identify the best candidates for an open position.
                            
                            Self-driving cars -- Machine learning algorithms can even make it possible for a semi-autonomous car to recognize a partially visible object and alert the driver.
                            
                            Virtual assistants -- Smart assistants typically combine supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to interpret natural speech and supply context.</p>
						<p>Choosing the right machine learning model
                           <ul>The process of choosing the right machine learning model to solve a problem can be time-consuming if not approached strategically. </ul>  
                            
                            <li>Step 1: Align the problem with potential data inputs that should be considered for the solution. This step requires help from data scientists and experts who have a deep understanding of the problem.</li></h1>
                            
                            <li>Step 2: Collect data, format it and label the data if necessary. This step is typically led by data scientists, with help from data wranglers.</li>
                            
                            <li>Step 3: Chose which algorithm(s) to use and test to see how well they perform. This step is usually carried out by data scientists.</li>
                            
                            <li>Step 4:  Continue to fine-tune outputs until they reach an acceptable level of accuracy. This step is usually carried out by data scientists with feedback from experts who have a deep understanding of the problem.</li></p>
                        
                        <p>The future of machine learning
                            While machine learning algorithms have been around for decades, they've attained new popularity as artificial intelligence (AI) has grown in prominence. Deep learning models, in particular, power today's most advanced AI applications.
                            
                            Machine learning platforms are among enterprise technology's most competitive realms, with most major vendors, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM and others, racing to sign customers up for platform services that cover the spectrum of machine learning activities, including data collection, data preparation, data classification, model building, training and application deployment.
                            
                            As machine learning continues to increase in importance to business operations and AI becomes ever more practical in enterprise settings, the machine learning platform wars will only intensify.
                            
                            How deep learning differs from traditional machine learning
                            Deep learning works in very different ways from traditional machine learning.
                    
                        Continued research into deep learning and AI is increasingly focused on developing more general applications. Today's AI models require extensive training in order to produce an algorithm that is highly optimized to perform one task. But some researchers are exploring ways to make models more flexible and are seeking techniques that allow a machine to apply context learned from one task to future, different tasks.</p>
