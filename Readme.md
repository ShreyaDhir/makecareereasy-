## Our Mission
Make Career Easy is proud to provide free or low-cost career and personality assessments for charities, non-profits, and schools. If you need to provide reliable career guidance to disadvantaged students or adults, we are here to help. Assessments can be costly. Often, they are out of the budget for those who need them most. Our mission is to ensure that professional quality, scientifically validated career and personality assessments are available to everyone who can benefit from them. Through this program we offer the Career Personality Profile (a career interests and personality inventory based on the Big Five personality models) and career guidance. The assessments are completed online, and are designed to integrate with our career information database. Your group's leader has access to a system that gives him or her full control over the group's assessment process, from signing up participants to viewing their results. If this sounds like a program that could benefit your organization, please email us and we will contact you to discuss your needs. We look forward to hearing from you!
